    <p class="indent-8">
      Deep learning has achieved great success, but understanding how it works
      is essential for building better and safer AI systems. Deep learning is a
      highly complex system. Studying phenomena—observable patterns in
      experiments—is a key way to understand such complexity. This approach
      mirrors how scientists study nature: through controlled experiments, they
      discover empirical laws that guide theory, which in turn leads to deeper
      understanding and useful technology. This project collects important
      phenomena in deep learning and provides a platform for researchers to
      share and discuss their findings. By gathering well-documented phenomena
      with reproducible experiments, we aim to help researchers identify open
      questions, connect theory with practice, and advance the field together.
